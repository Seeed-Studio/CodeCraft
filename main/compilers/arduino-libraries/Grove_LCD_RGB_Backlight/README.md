Done with the tedious mono color backlight? This Grove - LCD RBG Backlight enables you to set the color to whatever you like via the simple and concise Grove interface. It takes I2C as the communication method with your microcontroller. The number of pins required for data exchange and backlight control shrinks from ~10 to 2, relieving IOs for other challenging tasks. In addition, Grove - LCD RGB Backlight supports user-defined characters. Want to get a love heart or another custom character? Just take advantage of this feature and design it!


## Usage:

This is an Arudino Library. It include a .h file, a .cpp file and some examples. Through these examples, you can quickly master the use of Grove - LCD RGB Backlight.

The in the following, we will introduce some functions which are used very intuitively. 


### Initialization
Before we use this lcd, we should initialize it. You can use this function:

    lcd.begin(16, 2);

This means that this lcd has 16 columns and 2 rows.

Optionally you can also specify the character size: LCD_5x10DOTS  or LCD_5x8DOTS which is the default

and for those board who support different Wire objects, which one:  

Example:
    lcd.begin(16, 2, LCD_5x8DOTS, Wire2);



### Change Color of Backlight
One of Grove - LCD RGB Backlight's most important feature is changing the backlight color. It's very simple; just use the folowing function:

    void setRGB(int r, int g, int b);


### Clear Display

You can clear the display by this function:

    void clear();

### Turn on and turn off display

    void noDisplay();			// turn off display
    void display();				// turn on display

### Blink

    void noBlink();
    void blink();

### Cursor

    void noCursor();
    void cursor();

### Blink LED Backlight

    void noBlinkLED();
    void blinkLED();

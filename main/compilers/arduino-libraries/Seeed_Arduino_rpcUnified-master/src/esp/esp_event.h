    it runs, returning control to the caller when that time expires (or some time afterwards). There is no guarantee
    that a call to this function will exit at exactly the time of expiry. There is also no guarantee that events have
    been dispatched during the call, as the function might have spent all of the alloted time waiting on the event queue.
    Once an event has been unqueued, however, it is guaranteed to be dispatched. This guarantee contributes to not being
    able to exit exactly at time of expiry as (1) blocking on internal mutexes is necessary for dispatching the unqueued
    event, and (2) during  dispatch of the unqueued event there is no way to control the time occupied by handler code
    execution. The guaranteed time of exit is therefore the alloted time + amount of time required to dispatch
    the last unqueued event.

    In cases where waiting on the queue times out, ESP_OK is returned and not ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT, since it is
    normal behavior.

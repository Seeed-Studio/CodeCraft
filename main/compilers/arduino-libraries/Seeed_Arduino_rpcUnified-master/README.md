Seeed Arduino rpcUnified is the SAMD side of eRPC protocol software. The eRPC protocol is used to implement API calls between different architectures and different chips. In this software library, we mainly implement the API calls related to Bluetooth and WiFi. It can communicate through UART, SPI, I2C and other interfaces.  we use UART to communicate in this software library. This software is called in the following software library, to achieve a very exciting function.

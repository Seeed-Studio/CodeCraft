[*Grove - Mini I2C Motor Driver*](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Grove%C2%A0%C2%A0I2C%C2%A0Mini%C2%A0Motor%C2%A0Driver-p-2508.html?cPath=91_92)

Arduino Library for the Grove - Moni I2C Motor Driver(SparkFun MiniMoto board), which uses the TI DRV8830 IC for I2C low-voltage DC motor control.
Communication protocol of I2C, operating voltage of 2.7V to 6.8V and is good for small robotics projects.
This library provides basic functionality.

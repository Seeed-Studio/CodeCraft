# NTP
The **NTP** library allows you to receive time information from the Internet. It also have support for
different timezones and daylight saving time (DST).
This NTP library uses the functions of the time.h standard library.

## Example
Example for WIFI boards like ESP32 or MKR1000, prints formatted time and date strings to console.

```cpp
#include "Arduino.h"
#include "WiFi.h"
#include "WiFiUdp.h"
#include "NTP.h"

const char *ssid     = "yourSSID"; // your network SSID
const char *password = "yourPASSWORD"; // your network PW

WiFiUDP wifiUdp;
NTP ntp(wifiUdp);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  WiFi.begin(ssid, password);
  while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) {
    Serial.println("Connecting ...");
    delay(500);
    }
  Serial.println("Connected");  
  ntp.ruleDST("CEST", Last, Sun, Mar, 2, 120); // last sunday in march 2:00, timetone +120min (+1 GMT + 1h summertime offset)
  ntp.ruleSTD("CET", Last, Sun, Oct, 3, 60); // last sunday in october 3:00, timezone +60min (+1 GMT)
  ntp.begin();
  Serial.println("start NTP");
  }

void loop() {
  ntp.update();
  Serial.println(ntp.formattedTime("%d. %B %Y")); // dd. Mmm yyyy
  Serial.println(ntp.formattedTime("%A %T")); // Www hh:mm:ss
  delay(1000);
  }
```

# Documentation

## NTP / ~NTP
onstructor / destructor for a NTP object

## void begin(bool blocking = true)
starts the underlaying UDP client, the function is normaly blocking if there is no connection, to unblock set begin(false);

## void stop()
stops the underlaying UDP client

## void update()
this must called in the main loop

## void ntpServer(const char* server)
set an other NTP server, default NTP server is "pool.ntp.org"

## void updateInterval(uint32\_t interval)
sets the update interval for connecting the NTP server in ms, default is 60000ms (60s)

## void ruleDST(const char* tzName, int8\_t week, int8\_t wday, int8\_t month, int8\_t hour, int tzOffset)
sets the rules for the daylight save time settings

- tzname is the name of the timezone, e.g. "CEST" (central europe summer time)
- week Last, First, Second, Third, Fourth (0 - 4)
- wday Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat (0 - 7)
- month Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec (0 -11)
- hour the local hour when rule changes
- tzOffset timezone offset in minutes

## char* ruleDST()
gives the DST time back, formatted as an ctime string

## void ruleSTD(const char* tzName, int8\_t week, int8\_t wday, int8\_t month, int8\_t hour, int tzOffset)
sets the rules for the standard time settings

- tzname is the name of the timezone, e.g. "CET" (central europe time)
- week Last, First, Second, Third, Fourth (0 - 4)
- wday Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat (0 - 7)
- month Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec (0 -11)
- hour the local hour when rule changes
- tzOffset timezone offset in minutes

## char* ruleSTD()
gives the STD time back, formatted as an ctime string

## char* tzName()
gives you the name of the current timezone, based on your rule settings

## void timeZone(int8\_t tzHours, int8\_t tzMinutes = 0)
only use this function when you don't made the rules setting,
you have to the set isDST(false)

## void isDST(bool dstZone)
use in conjunction with timeZone, when there is no DST!

## bool isDST()
gives the DST status back, true if summertime

## time_t epoch()
get the Unix epoch timestamp

## int16\_t year(), int8\_t month(), int8\_t day(), int8\_t weekDay(), int8\_t hours(), int8\_t minutes(), int8\_t seconds()
get the datas from the tm structure of the "time.h" library

## char* formattedTime(const char *format)
gives back a string, formated with strftime function of standard time library

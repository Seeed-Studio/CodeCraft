# Seeed ICM20600 + AK09918 Library

This is the Arduino Library for Seeed's ICM20600 + AK09918 based products. For now, it's Grove - IMU 9DOF(ICM20600+AK09918).


ICM20600 is a 6-axis MotionTracking device that combines a 3aixs-gyroscope with programmable FSR of ±250 dps, ±500dps, ±1000dps, ±2000dps and a 3aixs-accelerometer with programmable FSR of ±2g, ±4g, ±8g, ±16g.


AK09918 is a 3axis electronic compass device, with 16-bit data out for each 3-axis(sensity 0.15uT/LSB) 

## Examples

### test_6axis

This example shows how to get gyroscope and acceleration data from ICM20600.

### test_magnet

This example shows how to get magnetic data from AK09918.

### compass

This example gets magnetic data and acceleration data, to count patch and roll, and make a compass application.

Grove OLED Display 1.12'' V1.0
===
It is a 16 color grayscale 96Ã—96 dot matrix OLED display module with Grove compatible 4pin I2C interface. Grove - OLED 96x96 is constructed with 96 x 96 dot matrix OLED module LY120 and SSD1327 driver IC. Comparing to LCD, OLED screens are more competitive, which has a number of advantages such as high brightness, self-emission, high contrast ratio, slim / thin outline, wide viewing angle, wide temperature range, and low power consumption.

- See ./examples/OLED_SSD1327_v1

When using V1.0 hardware, please check initialize functionality before uploading Arduino sketch.
```
SeeedGrayOled.init(SSD1327);
```

Grove OLED Display 1.12'' V2.0
===
**Note that the OLED v2.0 has a 128x128 dot matrix OLED display, when showing image, bitmap size should be 128x128 pixel.**

- See ./examples/OLED_SH1107G_v2

Change driver IC to SH1107G, when using V2.0 hardware, please check initialize functionality before uploading Arduino sketch.


```
SeeedGrayOled.init(SH1107G);
```

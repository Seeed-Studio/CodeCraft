[Grove - Temperature&Humidity Sensor Pro（AM2302)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Temperature%26Humidity-Sensor-Pro%EF%BC%88AM2302%EF%BC%89-p-838.html)

This temperature & humidity sensor provides a pre-calibrated digital output. A unique capacitive sensor element measures relative humidity and the temperature is measured by a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor. It has excellent reliability and long term stability.

Localization for the Scratch 3.0 editor - https://www.transifex.com/llk/public

This repository collects translations submitted to the Scratch projects on Transifex. **Please do not submit PRs. If you would like to contribute translations, please sign up to translate on Transifex.**

July 2017 Note: The project for the Scratch 3.0 editor is not yet public on Transifex as we're actively changing the code and the strings to translate are not yet stable. When the strings to translate are stable enough that it would be productive for translators to start translating we'll make it public. Thanks for your patience.

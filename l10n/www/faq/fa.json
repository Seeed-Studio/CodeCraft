    "faq.requirementsTitle":"What are the system requirements for Scratch?",
    "faq.requirementsBody":"To run Scratch 2.0, you need to be using (1) a Windows, ChromeOS, Mac, or Linux computer; (2) a version of <a href=\"https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/\">Adobe Flash Player</a> released on or after June 15, 2016; (3) a relatively recent web browser: one of the latest two versions of <a href=\"http://google.com/chrome/\">Chrome</a> (Windows, ChromeOS, Mac or Linux), <a href=\"http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/\">Firefox</a> (Windows or Mac only), <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/downloads/safari\">Safari</a> (Mac only), <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/windows/microsoft-edge\">Edge</a> (Windows only), or <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/download/internet-explorer.aspx\">Internet Explorer 11</a> (Windows only). If your computer doesn’t meet these requirements, you can try downloading and installing <a href=\"/scratch_1.4\">Scratch 1.4</a>, which you can still use to share projects to the Scratch 2.0 website.",
    "faq.offlineTitle":"Do you have a downloadable version so I can create and view projects offline?",
    "faq.offlineBody":"The Scratch 2.0 offline editor allows you to create Scratch projects without an internet connection.

Note: You can have both Scratch 1.4 and 2.0 on your computer.",
    "faq.uploadOldTitle":"Can I still upload projects created with older versions of Scratch to the website?",
    "faq.uploadOldBody":"Yes - you can share or upload projects made with earlier versions of Scratch, and they will be visible and playable. (However, you can’t download projects made with or edited in later versions of Scratch and open them in earlier versions. For example, you can’t open a Scratch 2.0 project in <a href=\"/scratch_1.4\">Scratch 1.4</a>, because <a href=\"/scratch_1.4\">Scratch 1.4</a> doesn’t know how to read the .sb2 project file format.)",
    "faq.recordVideoTitle":"Can I record a video of my Scratch project?",
    "faq.recordVideoBody":"Yes, you can record a video of your Scratch project up to 60 seconds. In the Scratch editor, from the File menu, select \"Record Project Video.\" (You need to be signed in to see this option.) You can choose additional recording options (such as recording sound and mouse clicks) through the \"More Options\" menu. Then, run your project however you'd like. Once the recording is done, follow the instructions to download the file to your computer. Depending on what kind of computer you have, you may need to download another program like the <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html\">VLC Media Player</a> to play the file. This file will run on YouTube, Vimeo, and Facebook, but may need to be converted for other websites like Twitter or Tumblr.",

    "faq.remixDefinitionTitle":"What is a remix?",
    "faq.remixDefinitionBody":"When a Scratcher makes a copy of someone else’s project and modifies it to add their own ideas (for example, by changing scripts or costumes), the resulting project is called a \"remix\". Every project shared to the Scratch website can be remixed. We consider even a minor change to be a valid remix, as long as credit is given to the original project creator and others who made significant contributions to the remix.",
    "faq.remixableTitle":"Why does the Scratch Team require that all projects be “remixable”?",
    "faq.remixableBody":"We believe that viewing and remixing interesting projects is a great way to learn to program, and leads to cool new ideas. That’s why the source code is visible for every project shared to the Scratch website.",
    "faq.creativeCommonsTitle":"What if I don’t want others to remix my projects?",
    "faq.creativeCommonsBody":"By publishing your project on the Scratch website, you agree to license it under a <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/deed.en\">Creative Commons Share Alike</a> license.

    "faq.fairUseTitle":"Can I use images / sounds / media from the internet in my projects?",
    "faq.fairUseBody":"It's important to respect the original creator’s wishes regarding remixing. If you choose to integrate someone else’s work into your own, be sure to give them credit on the project “credits” section, and include a link back to the original. To find art / sounds that are already licensed for remixing, check out the <a href=\"http://search.creativecommons.org/\">Creative Commons search page</a>.",
    "faq.confirmedAccountTitle":"What is a “confirmed” Scratch account?",

    "faq.checkConfirmedTitle":"How can I check whether my account has been confirmed?",
    "faq.checkConfirmedBody":"To check whether your account is confirmed, you must first log into your Scratch account in the top right of the screen.

    "faq.forgotPasswordTitle":"I forgot my password. How can I reset it?",
    "faq.forgotPasswordBody":"Enter your account name on the <a href=\"/accounts/password_reset/\">password reset page</a>. The website will send an email to the address associated with the account containing a link you can use to reset your password.",

    "faq.multipleLoginTitle":"Is it OK to have more than one person logged into an account?",
    "faq.multipleLoginBody":"This is discouraged, because the website and project editor can easily get confused when more than one person is logged into the same account.",
    "faq.changeUsernameTitle":"Can I change my username?",
    "faq.changeUsernameBody":"The structure of the Scratch website depends on having a consistent account name, so it’s not possible to change your username. If you really need to, you can make a new account - but you'll have to copy your projects over on your own.",
    "faq.shareInfoTitle":"What information can I share on / with my account?",
    "faq.shareInfoBody":"Please don’t share personal contact information, such as your physical address, email, phone number, or anything else that can be used to make contact outside of the Scratch website.

    "faq.noFlameTitle":"What do I do if I see someone being mean or disrespectful?",
    "faq.noFlameBody":"Don’t add to the flames! Responding to mean comments with more mean comments just makes things worse, and could result in your account being blocked.

We check reports every day, multiple times per day - so rest assured, we'll sort things out.",
    "faq.reviewContentTitle":"What does the Scratch team do when something is reported or flagged?",
    "faq.reviewContentBody":"The Scratch Team reviews reported comments and projects every day.

    "faq.blockedAccountBody":"When an account is blocked, the owner can no longer access it, or use it to create projects or comments. When they login, they see a page that explains why the account was blocked with a web form they can use to request to be unblocked. If the owner can show that they understand why their account was blocked, and promises to follow the community guidelines in the future, the  Scratch Team will review their case.

    "faq.stolenAccountBody":"You are responsible for keeping your password secure.

    "faq.cloudLagTitle":"How long does it take for cloud data to reach another Scratcher?",
    "faq.cloudLagBody":"It depends. If both Scratchers have a reasonably fast Internet connection (DSL/Cable), and there are no restrictive firewalls on the computers/network, updates should be transmitted in milliseconds. However, a lot of computers have firewall software running in them, and if the firewall software blocks outgoing connections to TCP port 531 and TCP port 843, the time-lag becomes one-second. We are currently trying to figure out ways in which we can work around this limitation.",

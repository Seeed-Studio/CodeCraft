  "developers.scratchBlocksIntro": "Scratch Blocks is a new development project for the next generation of graphical programming blocks, based on a collaboration between Google and MIT’s Scratch Team — building on Google’s {blocklyLink} and informed by the Scratch Team’s expertise in developing creative learning tools for young people. Scratch Blocks will provide a framework for building programming blocks in both vertical (text-based) and horizontal (icon-based) formats. You can access the code (currently as a developer-preview) and documentation {githubLink}.",

  "developers.principlesIntro": "We created Scratch to empower young people to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. We are guided by a set of {learningPrinciples} and {designPrinciples} that we hope you will follow as you develop new tools and technologies with Scratch Blocks.",
  "developers.jrBodyWebsiteLinkText": "ScratchJr website",

  "developers.learningPrinciplesProjectsBody": "People learn best when they are actively working on projects — generating new ideas, designing prototypes, making improvements and creating final products.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPassionTitle": "Passion",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPassionBody": "When people focus on things they care about, they work longer and harder, persist in the face of challenges, and learn more in the process.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPeersTitle": "Peers",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPeersBody": "Learning flourishes as a social activity, with people sharing ideas, collaborating on projects, and building on one another's work.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPlayTitle": "Play",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPlayBody": "Learning involves playful experimentation — trying new things, tinkering with materials, testing boundaries, taking risks, iterating again and again.",
  "developers.designPrinciplesRoomTitle": "Low Floor & Wide Walls",
  "developers.designPrinciplesRoomBody": "In order to encourage a varied and diverse set of interactions, we explicitly include elements and features that are easy for kids to understand (low floor), but general enough to support diverse uses (wide walls).",
  "developers.designPrinciplesSimpleTitle": "Make it as Simple as Possible — And Maybe Even Simpler",
  "developers.designPrinciplesSimpleBody": "Despite the common drive to add more features to software products, we have found that reducing the number of features often improves the user experience. What initially seems like a constraint or limitation can foster new forms of creativity.",
  "developers.designPrinciplesGlobalTitle": "Many Paths, Many Styles",
  "developers.designPrinciplesGlobalBody": "Many math and science activities have traditionally been biased towards specific populations. By paying special attention to creating accessible and appealing technologies, we are working to close the gap.",
  "developers.designPrinciplesTinkerTitle": "Design for Tinkerability",
  "developers.designPrinciplesTinkerBody": "We believe that the learning process is inherently iterative. Tinkerers start by exploring and experimenting, then revising and refining their goals and creations. To support this style of interaction, we design our interfaces to encourage quick experimentation and rapid cycles of iteration.",
  "developers.joinBodyJobsLinkText": "Jobs Page",
  "developers.joinBody": "We're a diverse group of educators, designers, and engineers, who work together in a playful, creative environment full of LEGO bricks, craft materials, and maker tools.

  "developers.faqRulesTitle": "Are there rules to using this code in my application?",
  "developers.faqRulesBody": "You may use this code in accordance with the license which governs each project. We also strongly encourage you to consider the learning and design principles (above, on this page) when building creative learning experiences for kids of all ages.",
  "developers.faqNameTitle": "Am I allowed to use the name \"Scratch Blocks\" in the description of my app and other public messaging?",
  "developers.faqNameBody": "If you wish, you can publicly state that your application is powered by Scratch Blocks. If you do so, we would also encourage you to link back to the code repository.",
  "developers.faqReleasesTitle": "Are you releasing more code and when?",

  "developers.scratchBlocksIntro": "Scratch Blocks is a new development project for the next generation of graphical programming blocks, based on a collaboration between Google and MIT’s Scratch Team — building on Google’s {blocklyLink} and informed by the Scratch Team’s expertise in developing creative learning tools for young people. Scratch Blocks will provide a framework for building programming blocks in both vertical (text-based) and horizontal (icon-based) formats. You can access the code (currently as a developer-preview) and documentation {githubLink}.",
  "developers.scratchBlocksBody": "This first release includes code for Scratch’s Horizontal Grammar. Looking ahead, we plan to release additional code including but not limited to the Vertical Grammar (currently used by Scratch), a new Rendering Engine to support sprites and graphic effects, and a new Audio Engine to support creation with sound and music.",

  "developers.DesignPrinciples": "Prionsabail Deartha",
  "developers.principlesIntro": "We created Scratch to empower young people to think creatively, reason systematically, and work collaboratively. We are guided by a set of {learningPrinciples} and {designPrinciples} that we hope you will follow as you develop new tools and technologies with Scratch Blocks.",
  "developers.jrBodyWebsiteLinkText": "ScratchJr website",
  "developers.jrBody": "ScratchJr is an introductory programming language that enables young children (ages 5-7) to create their own interactive stories and games. For more information, visit the {websiteLink} or access the code and documentation on {githubLink}.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesProjectsBody": "People learn best when they are actively working on projects — generating new ideas, designing prototypes, making improvements and creating final products.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPassionTitle": "Díograis",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPassionBody": "Nuair a dhíríonn daoine ar chúrsaí a bhfuil suim acu iontu, déanann siad níos mó oibre, oibríonn siad níos crua, leanann siad ar aghaidh in ainneoin na ndúshlán, agus foghlaimíonn siad níos mó.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPeersTitle": "Comhghleacaithe",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPeersBody": "Téann an fhoghlaim chun cinn mar ghníomhaíocht shóisialta, ina bhfuil daltaí ag roinnt smaointe, ag comhoibriú ar thionscadail, agus ag tógáil ar obair a chéile.",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPlayTitle": "Cas",
  "developers.learningPrinciplesPlayBody": "Learning involves playful experimentation — trying new things, tinkering with materials, testing boundaries, taking risks, iterating again and again.",

  "developers.designPrinciplesRoomBody": "Chun idirghníomhaíochtaí éagsúla ilghnéitheacha a spreagadh, cuirimid eilimintí agus gnéithe ar fáil atá sothuigthe ag páistí (urlár íseal), ach sách ginearálta chun gníomhaíochtaí difriúla a cheadú (ballaí leathana).",
  "developers.designPrinciplesSimpleTitle": "Déan é chomh simplí agus is féidir — nó fiú níos simplí",
  "developers.designPrinciplesSimpleBody": "Despite the common drive to add more features to software products, we have found that reducing the number of features often improves the user experience. What initially seems like a constraint or limitation can foster new forms of creativity.",
  "developers.designPrinciplesGlobalTitle": "Go Leor Cosán, Go Leor Stíleanna",
  "developers.designPrinciplesGlobalBody": "Many math and science activities have traditionally been biased towards specific populations. By paying special attention to creating accessible and appealing technologies, we are working to close the gap.",
  "developers.designPrinciplesTinkerTitle": "Design for Tinkerability",
  "developers.designPrinciplesTinkerBody": "We believe that the learning process is inherently iterative. Tinkerers start by exploring and experimenting, then revising and refining their goals and creations. To support this style of interaction, we design our interfaces to encourage quick experimentation and rapid cycles of iteration.",
  "developers.joinBodyJobsLinkText": "Jobs Page",
  "developers.joinBody": "We're a diverse group of educators, designers, and engineers, who work together in a playful, creative environment full of LEGO bricks, craft materials, and maker tools.

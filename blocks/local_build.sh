# Usage: local_build.sh.
#
# This script generates only local_blockly_compressed_vertical.js.  You may
# modify it as needed to build other files.
#
# The compressed file is a concatenation of all of Scratch-Blocks's core files,
# run through a local copy of Google's Closure Compiler with simple
# optimizations turned on.

# Future work:
# - Trim down Google's Apache licenses, to match the output of build.py.
# - Generate other compressed files generated by build.py normally.
# - Add a good error message if multiple versions of the closure compiler were
#   found.
# - Add a flag for generating horizontal (still default to vertical).

# Find the Closure Compiler.
